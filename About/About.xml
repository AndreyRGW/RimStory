	# RimStory

Since starting my first colony in Rimworld I thought this game is about the Story.
I remember well my first dead colonists, first marriage in colony... I remember how one guy, who barely know anything about medicine rescued all his pals. 

I really, really miss those times.

That's why Im making RimStory.

RimStory is logging all important events in colony life- deads, marriages, great battles and failures. Colonists also remember those events- they will start marriage anniversary party, memorial day of fallen comrads etc.
