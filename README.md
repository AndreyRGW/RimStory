# RimStory

Since starting my first colony in Rimworld I thought the game should be about the Story.
I remember well when my first colonist die, first marriage in colony, raids... i remember how one guy, who barely knew about medicine, rescued all his palls.

I really, really miss those times.

That's why I made RimStory.

RimStory logs all important events of life in a colony life for example: deaths, marriages, epic battles and failures as well.

The colonists will organize anniversary parties, raise their glasses for their fallen comrades on the day they have died and so on!
